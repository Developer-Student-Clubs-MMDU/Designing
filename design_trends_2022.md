# Design trends 2022
Here are some of the design trends in 2022

1. **Mixed 3D and 2D Elements**
* Along with 3D characters, we are more and more used to seeing the combination of 3D and 2D elements in a design. 
The contrast between them is generally eye-catching and beautiful. It adds depth to the design at hand. For example, look at Neverland’s hero image:

2. **Hand-drawn or Custom Illustrations**
* Hand-drawn illustrations make your design more authentic for sure. Authentic images are like a signature you put in your design which helps the user feel more connected to what they see on the screen.
In other words, it makes your design more human and appeals to emotions than stock images.

3. **Inclusive Visuals**
* We are all more sensitive to inclusivity and diversity in 2022, especially after the BlackLivesMatter and MeToo movements. We can see traces of them in today’s social media content as well as apps. It’s a big red flag to include only white men characters in your in-app visuals presenting the community. So, as a designer, you, too, have a part in social inclusion, and the users very much appreciate it.
That’s how trends become trends.
